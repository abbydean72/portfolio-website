            <h1>About Me:</h1>
            <p>Hello! Thank you for checking out my portfolio website! I'm a passionate professional, and I've been working in the aviation industry for about 7 years. Long term, I would like to pursue a career in software development.</p>
            <p>My coding journey started off and on about 8 years ago. While working on my Associates of Arts at Front Range Community College I took a few Java classes, but ultimately my focus was on completing my Private Pilots License. About a year ago, I decided to seriously pursue a career in Software development. This decision has ignited a passion for learning how technology really works, and how to actualy code, not just copy the syntax written in a textbook. Since then, I have been deep diving into various programming languages and technologies. It's been a struggle, trying to balance my career in aviation and this new coding journey, but it has also been incredibly rewarding. I'm very excited to see where this new path will take me, and I hope you are too!</p>
            <p>I have worked as a line service supervisor at Sheltair Avaiton in Broomfield, CO for about 3 years now. In this position I have learned many skills in leadership and customer service. Whether it’s fueling, towing, marshaling, de-icing, or managing the ramp, I’m right there with my team, making sure everything runs smoothly. I take pride in being a mentor and trainer, helping others grow in their roles.</p>
            <p>Outside of coding and fueling airplanes, I have many different hobbies. I have been flying since 2017, and earned my Pilots license in 2018. Since then I have enjoyed flying whenever I can, in addition to painting and rock tumbling. I have also been learning to snowboard, and have been working on a few project motorcycles, and trying to learn the inner mechanics of a small engine. </p>
